#  **Data Preparation (SQL in SSMS)**

Raw tables from transactional systems (sales, customers, menu items, stores, feedback) were cleaned and enriched using SQL.

### Key transformations included:

✔ Joining transaction + feedback data into a combined analytical fact
✔ Calculating revenue, discounts, and promotion flags
✔ Creating customer demographics (age bands, gender normalization)
✔ Categorizing menu items into business-friendly groups
✔ Standardizing store attributes
✔ Creating sentiment and NPS categories
✔ Extracting behavioral metrics (weekday/weekend patterns)

The output results in **clean analytical tables** ready for BI modeling.
